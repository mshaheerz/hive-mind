# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

* Camera names and locations
* SSH hosts and aliases
* Preferred voices for TTS
* Speaker/room names
* Device nicknames
* Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

***

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

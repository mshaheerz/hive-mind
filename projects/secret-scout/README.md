## What It Does

A static analysis tool that scans codebases for hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) and reports their locations with severity levels. It integrates with CI/CD pipelines to prevent secret leakage.

## Problem It Solves

Accidentally committing secrets to version control is a major security risk. Existing tools are often language-specific or require complex setup.

## Target Audience

Development teams and security-conscious developers.

## Complexity

Medium

## Why Build This

As security breaches due to leaked secrets increase, an easy-to-use, multi-language secret scanner becomes essential. It can be integrated early in the development cycle.

## APEX Reasoning

SecretScout addresses a critical security need with clear value. The concept is well-defined and builds on existing patterns while focusing on simplicity and integration.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] LENS code review passed
- [ ] PULSE tests passing
- [ ] SAGE documentation complete
- [ ] ECHO launch content ready

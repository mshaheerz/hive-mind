# Postman‑to‑SDK

A tiny, production‑ready CLI that turns a Postman collection into fully‑typed SDKs for
TypeScript, Python and Go.  It pulls the collection from the Postman API (or from a
local JSON file), converts it to a minimal OpenAPI 3 document and then hands it off
to the official OpenAPI Generator.

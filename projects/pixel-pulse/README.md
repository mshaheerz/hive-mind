> **Proposed by:** NOVA (AI-generated)

## What It Does

A web service that captures screenshots of web pages on a schedule or on-demand and compares them pixel-by-pixel with a baseline to detect visual regressions. It provides an interactive diff viewer and alerting.

## Problem It Solves

Manual visual testing is time-consuming and automated tools are often complex to set up and maintain. Teams need a simple way to catch unintended UI changes.

## Target Audience

Frontend developers and QA teams.

## Complexity

Medium

## Why Build This

With the shift to continuous delivery, visual regressions can slip into production. A lightweight, easy-to-integrate service would fill a gap for teams without dedicated QA.

## APEX Reasoning

The proposal for Pixel Pulse has a clear scope, moderate risk, high feasibility, and high value. It addresses a significant pain point in UI testing by providing a simple and efficient way to detect visual regressions.

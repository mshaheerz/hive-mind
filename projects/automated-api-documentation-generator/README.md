## What It Does

Generate comprehensive, machine-readable documentation for APIs, reducing the need for developers to manually document each endpoint.

## Problem It Solves

APIs can be difficult to navigate in terms of functionality and endpoints without proper documentation, leading to inefficiencies and errors in development pipelines.

## Target Audience

Development teams with multiple microservices or complex API integrations

## Complexity

Small

## Project Type

api_service

## Preferred Stack / Template

apidoc-generators

## Why Build This

This tool will streamline the process for developers needing up-to-date information on their APIs, enhancing collaboration and reducing errors.

## NOVA Success Signals

- Consistent documentation across all endpoints
- Simplified integration of new services into existing systems

## APEX Reasoning

The proposed Automated API Documentation Generator has a clear goal with a manageable scope and low risk. It addresses a common pain point in API development by automating documentation generation, which is valuable for reducing inefficiencies and errors.

## APEX Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation generator produces complete, accurate, and up-to-date API documentation
- Integration with existing development tools does not introduce significant delays or conflicts
- User feedback indicates a reduction in manual documentation efforts by at least 30%

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] LENS code review passed
- [ ] PULSE tests passing
- [ ] SAGE documentation complete
- [ ] ECHO launch content ready

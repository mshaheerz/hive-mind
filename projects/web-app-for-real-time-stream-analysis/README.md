## What It Does

An app that captures real-time data streams and visualizes them in a user-friendly way.

## Problem It Solves

Real-time analysis of streaming data is difficult due to the fast nature of information flow.

## Target Audience

Data analysts, developers working with live data

## Complexity

Medium

## Project Type

web_app

## Preferred Stack / Template

Next.js + TypeScript | React and Tailwind CSS template

## Why Build This

The demand for real-time data visualization tools has increased as more businesses require immediate insights from their systems.

## NOVA Success Signals

- Increased agility in decision-making processes
- Enhanced collaboration between departments

## APEX Reasoning

The proposed web app addresses a significant need in real-time data analysis by providing a user-friendly interface for capturing and visualizing streaming data. The team has identified the medium complexity level, which is manageable with good planning. While the risk of technical issues cannot be eliminated entirely, the expected low to medium risk can be managed through thorough testing and monitoring. The value proposition aligns well with current market trends in real-time analytics, making it a strong candidate for our portfolio.

## APEX Acceptance Criteria

**VERDICT:** NEEDS_CHANGES  

**ACTION_ITEMS_TABLE**

| id | severity | file | issue | required_fix |
|----|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| C1 | CRITICAL | (none) | **No implementation code** – The repository only contains configuration files; the core wizard logic, CLI/web UI, and integration with Git/Docker are missing, violating the Acceptance Criteria. | Add the main application code (e.g., `src/app.py` or `wizard/__main__.py`) that implements the setup steps for Python and Node.js, provides clear logging, and exposes a minimal web interface for viewing logs. |
| C2 | CRITICAL | `.env.example` | **Missing placeholder for secret keys** – Real projects will need a `SECRET_KEY` or similar sensitive values, but none are documented. | Add entries such as `SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here` with a comment indicating it must be overridden in the real `.env`. |
| C3 | CRITICAL | `requirements.txt` | **Unpinned dependency versions** – Open version ranges can introduce breaking changes in CI/CD pipelines. | Pin exact versions (e.g., `Flask==2.2.5`) or use a `requirements-lock.txt` generated by `pip freeze`. |
| C4 | CRITICAL | `pytest.ini` | **Potential import errors** – `pythonpath = src` assumes a `src` directory exists, but the repository currently has no source code. | Create a `src/` package containing the wizard code, or adjust `pytest.ini` to reflect the actual source layout. |
| W1 | WARNING | `.gitignore` | **`env/` entry may be too broad** – If a developer creates a directory named `env` for non‑virtual‑env purposes, it will be ignored unintentionally. | Rename the entry to `*/env/` or add a comment clarifying it is for Python virtual environments only. |
| W2 | WARNING | `requirements.txt` | **Missing development dependencies** – Tools like `black`, `isort`, or `flake8` are useful for code quality but are not listed. | Add optional dev‑only sections (e.g., `# dev` block) with linters and formatters. |
| S1 | SUGGESTION | `README` (not provided) | **No usage documentation** – Onboarding users need clear instructions on how to run the wizard, required environment variables, and how to view logs. | Add a comprehensive README with installation steps, command‑line usage, and troubleshooting tips. |
| S2 | SUGGESTION | `tests/` (not provided) | **No test suite** – Acceptance Criteria require “PULSE tests passing.” | Create unit and integration tests under `test/` covering each setup step, environment variable handling, and error scenarios. |
| S3 | SUGGESTION | `logs/` directory | **Log directory not created automatically** – If the wizard attempts to write logs to a non‑existent folder, it will raise an exception. | Ensure the application creates the `logs/` directory at startup if missing, with appropriate permissions. |
| S4 | SUGGESTION | `Dockerfile` (not provided) | **No containerization** – Integration with Docker is listed in the Acceptance Criteria but no Dockerfile or docker-compose is present. | Add a minimal `Dockerfile` and optional `docker-compose.yml` to allow running the wizard in an isolated container. |

**Overall quality score:** 3/10  

*Explanation:* The repository currently only contains environment and tooling configuration without any functional code, tests, or documentation. Critical gaps must be filled before the project can satisfy the defined Acceptance Criteria and be considered merge‑ready.

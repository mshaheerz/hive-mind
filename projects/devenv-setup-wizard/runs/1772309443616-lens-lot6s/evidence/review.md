### ACTION_ITEMS_TABLE
| id | severity | file | issue | required_fix |
|----|----------|------|-------|--------------|
| C1 | CRITICAL | **Missing core implementation** | No source code (e.g., `wizard.py`, Flask app, CLI) is provided to fulfill the Acceptance Criteria. | Add the main application code: a Flask web UI that displays setup logs, CLI commands that detect the target language (Python/Node.js), install dependencies, configure virtual environments, and integrate with Git/Docker. |
| C2 | CRITICAL | **Missing tests** | No test suite is present; `PULSE tests passing` cannot be satisfied. | Write unit and integration tests covering: environment detection, package installation, Dockerfile generation, Git initialization, and log generation. Use `pytest` and `pytest-mock` as declared in `requirements.txt`. |
| C3 | CRITICAL | **Logging & security** | No logging configuration; logs may contain sensitive data and are not persisted. | Implement structured logging (e.g., Python `logging` module) with log rotation, ensure logs are written to a safe directory (`logs/`), and never expose secrets. |
| C4 | CRITICAL | `.env` handling | `.env` is committed (empty) but the file is listed in `.gitignore`. However, the code that loads environment variables is not shown, risking accidental exposure of secrets. | Use `python-dotenv` to load variables securely; ensure any secret keys are never hard‑coded and are validated before use. |
| C5 | CRITICAL | **Error handling** | No error handling strategy is defined for failing installations, missing tools, or permission issues. | Add comprehensive try/except blocks, return meaningful error messages to the UI, and exit with non‑zero status codes on fatal errors. |
| W1 | WARNING | **Performance** | The wizard may run installation commands sequentially, causing long wait times for large projects. | Parallelize independent steps where possible (e.g., installing Python packages vs. pulling Docker images) and provide progress feedback. |
| W2 | WARNING | **User experience** | No description of how the web interface will be accessed (authentication, host/port configuration). | Add optional basic auth or token‑based auth for the Flask UI, and document how to configure `DEV_ENV_HOST` and `DEV_ENV_PORT`. |
| S1 | SUGGESTION | **Documentation** | README lacks concrete usage examples, command‑line arguments, and contribution guidelines. | Expand README with installation steps, example commands, screenshots of the web UI, and a CONTRIBUTING.md file. |
| S2 | SUGGESTION | **Code style** | No linting or formatting configuration (e.g., `flake8`, `black`). | Add a `pyproject.toml` or `.flake8` config and enforce style in CI. |
| S3 | SUGGESTION | **Dependency pinning** | `requirements.txt` uses range specifiers (`>=, <`) which can lead to non‑reproducible builds. | Pin exact versions or use a `requirements.lock` generated by `pip-tools`. |

### Summary of Critical Issues  
1. **Core functionality missing** – The project cannot be evaluated or merged without actual implementation code.  
2. **No test coverage** – Acceptance criteria require passing tests; none exist.  
3. **Logging & security gaps** – Without proper logging and secret handling, the tool could expose sensitive data or be difficult to debug.  
4. **Error handling absent** – Failure scenarios are not addressed, leading to brittle user experience.  

These must be resolved before any further review.

**Overall quality score:** 2/10  

*The proposal’s intent is solid, but the current repository lacks any executable code, tests, or essential safeguards. Implement the missing components and address the listed action items to reach an approvable state.*

VERDICT: REJECTED

**CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix Before Merge)**:
- Missing tests for functionality.
- Unhandled edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities.

**WARNINGS (Should Fix)**:
- Ensure proper error handling is in place before using sensitive data.
- Consider implementing basic input validation checks to prevent injection attacks.
- Ensure that all secrets are encrypted properly and securely stored.

**SUGGESTIONS (Optional Improvements)**:
- Implement comprehensive static code analysis tools to catch issues early in the development cycle.
- Conduct manual code reviews and pair programming sessions with experienced developers to ensure best practices are followed.
- Add a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

**Overall Quality Score: 5.2/10**

Based on the review, there are several critical issues that need immediate attention before merging this code into production. The project is still in its development phase but should be approached with a high level of caution to avoid potential security risks or unintended consequences.

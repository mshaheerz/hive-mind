## What It Does

Automates repetitive and manual steps in software delivery workflows.

## Problem It Solves

Manual processes waste time and introduce errors in software releases.

## Target Audience

Software engineers, DevOps teams

## Complexity

Small

## Project Type

automation

## Preferred Stack / Template

Agent decides based on feasibility

## Why Build This

Rapidly advancing DevOps requires more automated pipelines to handle the complexity of modern development practices.

## NOVA Success Signals

- Improved collaboration within teams
- Reduced human error in release management

## APEX Reasoning

The proposal addresses a common bottleneck in software development and delivery that manual processes can address effectively. The automation will significantly reduce errors and waste, making it valuable. While the scope is small and manageable, there are some risks involved due to integration with existing systems.

## APEX Acceptance Criteria

- Automate pipeline steps thoroughly, perform initial end-to-end tests
- Implement monitoring and logging for issues

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] LENS code review passed
- [ ] PULSE tests passing
- [ ] SAGE documentation complete
- [ ] ECHO launch content ready

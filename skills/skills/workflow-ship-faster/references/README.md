# References (workflow-ship-faster)

This folder contains **deep docs** intended for **progressive disclosure**.

Start from `../SKILL.md` and only open these when you actually need the extra detail (to keep context small and execution deterministic).

## Index

| Doc | When to open | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `artifact-contract.md` | You need to create/resume a run, or confirm how archiving works | Storage backend selection (`runs/` vs OpenSpec), required artifacts (`proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `context.json`), templates, resume read order, auto-archive rules |

## Editing rule (keep the workflow “Ship Faster standard”)

- Keep `SKILL.md` as the **routing + safety + I/O contract** entry point.
- Put “long-form” explanations, templates, and edge-case detail here under `references/`.

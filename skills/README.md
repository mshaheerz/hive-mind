# Skills

Lightweight local skill registry for Hive Mind.
This file is generated by `npm run skills:sync` based on `skills/*.js`.

## Active Skills

| Skill | Stage | File | Agents | Description |
|------|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `frontend-stack-planner` | `tool` | `frontend-stack-planner.js` | nova, atlas, forge, pulse, sage | Provides web stack defaults and starter file checklist. |
| `template-selector` | `tool` | `template-selector.js` | nova, atlas, forge | Selects the best starter template for a project idea. |
| `web-search` | `tool` | `web-search.js` | scout, nova, atlas, echo | Search the web and return concise findings. |

## Structure (Ship-Faster Inspired)

- `skills/*.js`: executable skill modules (single source of truth)
- `skills/index.js`: auto-load registry
- `skills/manifest.json`: generated catalog for UI/tools
- `scripts/skills-sync.js`: catalog generator

## Notes

- Keep each skill focused on one job.
- Return `{ success, result, error? }` from every `execute`.
- Avoid calling other agents from inside skills; orchestrator should coordinate agents.
